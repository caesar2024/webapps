# Webapps

This repository contains self-contained webapps. The webapps are similar in design and purpose to those described in Petters (2021). However, in contrast to this earlier work, the apps here are written in Javascript and can be embedded directly into any static website.

Example App: 
- [https://caesar2024.github.io/webapps/xowh/](https://caesar2024.github.io/webapps/xowh/) 

Examples use case of embedded apps: 
- [https://caesar2024.github.io/](https://caesar2024.github.io/)

Hosting: 
- The apps are currently hosted via GitHub pages. However, they can in principle be hosted on any web server.

Example embed code:
```html
<div class="myframe">
<iframe class="responsive-iframe" src="https://caesar2024.github.io/webapps/xowh/" style="border:none;"></iframe>
</div>
```


## Available apps
Each app is designated by a four letter random string. A list of apps is provided below

### xowh 
- Interactive exploration of the droplet size distribution 
- [https://caesar2024.github.io/webapps/xowh/](https://caesar2024.github.io/webapps/xowh/)
